The IEEE International Workshop on Big Data Analytics for Cyber Threat Hunting (CyberHunt 2020) is organized by the Digital Security Research Group of the University of Oslo (Norway) in conjunction with the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2020). The workshop will be held during Dec 10-13, 2020, in Atlanta, GA, USA.

### Workshop Description

As cyber-crimes against critical infrastructure and large organizations increase and evolve, automated systems to supplement human analysis are required. In addition, hunting for breaches is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Such organizations are so large, with so much information and data to sort for actionable intelligence, that just knowing where to begin seems impossible. Intelligence analysis of an attack is traditionally an iterative mainly manual process going through unlimited amounts of data trying to determine sophisticated patterns and behaviors of intruders. Furthermore, most detected intrusions will provide a limited set of attributes about a single phase of an attack. Knowing all the stages of an intrusion accurately and in a timely manner would allow us to aid our cyber detective and preventive capabilities, as well as enrich our cyber threat intelligence and facilitate immediate threat information sharing, since we put several pieces together. The workshop is expected to address the aforementioned issues and will aim at presenting novel research in the area of cyber-threat hunting, cyber-threat intelligence, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. The research can have a special focus on AI and Big Data.

### Research Topics

Any novel research related to cyber threat intelligence, incident and threat response, threat hunting, and security automation and orchestration is welcome.

Some suggested topics are:

* Cyber Threat Intelligence (strategic, operational, tactical, technical)
* Models for forecasting cyber-attacks and measuring impact
*	Threat actor groups & techniques
*	Semantic modeling, data representation and fusion for CTI
*	Models that take into consideration Deception and Uncertainty in cyber-attack attribution
*	Indicators of compromise and how to detect/mitigate
*	Visualization techniques for intelligence analysis and investigation
*	Legal, privacy and ethical factors in intelligence analysis
*	Data analytics for security
*	Threat Hunting
*	Intrusion and anomaly detection and prevention
*	Incident Response
*	Monetization of cybercrime
*	Open Source tools
*	Relevant geopolitical cybersecurity research
*	Security Automation
*	Security Orchestration

CyberHunt 2020 invites full-length paper submissions that report ongoing or finished research (up to 10 pages), or short papers of early stage work (up to 6 pages).

Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines using Letter page format (8.5" x 11").

All accepted papers will be included in the IEEE Big Data 2020 Conference Proceedings and forwarded for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper in order to include the paper in the proceedings.
